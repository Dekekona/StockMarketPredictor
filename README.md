# StockMarketPredictor

This stock market predictor was created thanks to a tutorial on YouTube (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O_BenficgE&ab_channel=Dataquest)

There's many ways that this predictor can be improved, but since it was my first ever machine-learning project, I decided to keep it simple.

The main machine-learning technique used in this predictor was Decision Tree Learning, and more specifically the Random Forest algorithm, using the sklearn library in python.

I look very forward to experimenting with more AI/ML techniques on this project as well as others in the future!
